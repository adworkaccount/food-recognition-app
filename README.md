# Food Recognition Android App

This Android application empowers users to identify food items simply by taking a picture or uploading an existing image. Whether you're curious about what's on your plate or want to quickly categorize a dish, this app provides a convenient and user-friendly solution.

## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the power of on-device machine learning for practical applications. By integrating a custom-trained TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model into an Android app, we've created a system capable of recognizing different types of food directly on the user's device, without requiring a constant internet connection for the core recognition functionality.

The app offers two primary ways for users to input images:

* **Capture Image:** Users can open their device's camera directly from within the app and take a photo of the food item they want to identify.
* **Upload Image:** Users can select an existing image of food from their device's photo gallery.

Once an image is provided, the app processes it using the integrated TFLite model. This model has been trained to recognize 20 distinct categories of food items. The result of this analysis is then presented to the user as the predicted food category.

## How It Works

The application's functionality can be broken down into the following key stages:

1.  **Image Acquisition:**
    * When the user chooses to **capture an image**, the app interacts with the device's camera to take a picture.
    * When the user chooses to **upload an image**, the app accesses the device's storage and allows the user to select an image file.

2.  **Image Preprocessing:**
    * The captured or uploaded image undergoes preprocessing to ensure it's in the correct format and size expected by the TFLite model. This might involve resizing the image, normalizing pixel values, or adjusting the aspect ratio.

3.  **Food Recognition using the TFLite Model:**
    * The preprocessed image is then fed as input to the integrated TFLite model.
    * The TFLite model, which is a lightweight version of a trained deep learning model, performs inference on the image. This involves a series of mathematical operations to analyze the visual features of the food item.
    * Based on its training, the model outputs a probability score for each of the 20 food categories it was trained to recognize.

4.  **Result Interpretation and Display:**
    * The app analyzes the output probabilities from the TFLite model. Typically, the food category with the highest probability score is considered the model's prediction.
    * The recognized food item (the category with the highest probability) is then displayed to the user in a clear and understandable manner within the app's interface.

**Under the Hood:**

* **TFLite Model:** The core of the recognition process is the TFLite model. This model was created by training a machine learning model (likely a Convolutional Neural Network - CNN) using a large dataset of images belonging to the 20 target food categories. This training was done using Python and a machine learning framework like Keras. The trained model was then converted to the TFLite format to optimize it for mobile device performance (smaller size and faster inference).
* **Android Implementation:** The Android app is built using Android Studio and likely utilizes Kotlin. It integrates the TFLite model using the TensorFlow Lite Android library. This library provides the necessary APIs to load and run the model on the device.

In essence, this app brings the power of image recognition, learned through a dedicated training process, directly to your fingertips, allowing for quick and easy identification of various food items.
